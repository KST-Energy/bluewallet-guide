# Passphrase Overview

The next step involves creating a passphrase. This prevents you from getting your funds stolen if someone gets access to your device and its PIN or to your 12-word backup.

### What is a passphrase?

* It acts as a password that you add on top of your wallet backup (12-word seed phrase).&#x20;
* You can create as many passphrase-protected wallets as you like, with each new passphrase generating a completely new wallet.&#x20;
* The default wallet does not have a passphrase, adding one gives you plausible deniability, meaning that you can unlock the device normally containing no to little funds, with the majority of your bitcoin in a passphrase-protected wallet.&#x20;
* If someone comes into contact with your 12-word seed or digital backup, they wonâ€™t be able to steal your funds since they also need the passphrase to unlock the funds.
