### <mark style="color:red;">**There are 5 rules to making a Bitcoin backup;**</mark>

1. If you do not have a backup and you lose access to the Blue Wallet on your phone, **you will lose access to the Bitcoin permanently.**
2. Each wallet you create in Blue Wallet has its own backup that you must write down - there is no general backup.
3. If someone finds the backup of your wallet, they can steal your money.
4. **Never store your passphrase in the same place as your backup.** Don’t leave them out in the open either, someone will take your bitcoin.
